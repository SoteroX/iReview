UP AND RUNNING
In order to get this app up and running locally first you must run
"npm install"
in the root folder

Next create a folder named 'config' in src and within 'config' a file named 'firebase.js'

inside firebase.js file paste in your firebase init code

Finally run "firebase init" which will create the firebase files for you and that is it.
If you need any help feel free to message me
