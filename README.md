In order to get this app up and running locally first you must run
"npm install"
in the root folder

Next create a folder named 'config' in src and within 'config' a file named 'firebase.js'

inside firebase.js file paste in your firebase init code

Finally run "firebase init" which will create the firebase files for you and that is it.
